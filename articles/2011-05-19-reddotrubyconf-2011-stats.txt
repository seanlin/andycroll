title: RedDotRubyConf 2011 Stats
date: 19/05/2011

I had to prepare a report as part of the post conference administrivia for sponsors, but mainly for the financial support of the [iDA](http://ida.gov.sg). There are a lot of forms and dreadful ASP websites too. So I thought it'd be interesting to share some of the charts produced.

## Attendees by Country

The understandable majority were Singapore-based but an impressive showing for most of the countries in the region.

Next year I want to capture the original nationalities of attendee's as well as their current residence, I think the audience was more international than even this chart suggests.

## Attendees by Company

Interesting (and good) to see the huge support given by HP, not only in their sponsorship but also in the numbers of people they sent.

Also good to see the presence of Anideo in the top 10: that's my company, why not checkout the stuff we're building?

## Attendees working with Ruby

Once again unsurprising to see the vast majority of attendees were full-time rubyists. Although still a nice big number!

## T-shirt sizes

Finally a chart that might be of use to organizers of other geek conferences. Ordering the right number of T-shirts is a tricky job, the lead times are pretty long and you want everyone to get one they can wear and you don't want to have to order too many! I think my sample size is pretty typical of a geek event, feel free to apply these percentages to your own event!
